<p><b> 2 PhD positions in plant ancient DNA research at the University of Bern, Switzerland </b></p>

<p>Within the framework of the SNSF Consolidator grant project ARIaDNA, two 4-year PhD positions are available at the Institute of Plant Sciences and Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research of the University of Bern, Switzerland. ARIaDNA aims to reconstruct how key European tree species responded to past environmental changes, using genetic data from ancient plant remains preserved in lake sediment archives. This work will provide critical insights for predicting future vegetation shifts and inform conservation strategies for alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>These two PhD positions provide a unique chance to contribute to ground-breaking research on forest ecosystems and climate adaptation through an interdisciplinary approach combining fieldwork, laboratory research, and computational modeling. Join us to help shape the future of climate change adaptation strategies for Europe's alpine forests!</p>

<p><b>Two PhD positions based in New Zealand – Characterising lake responses to climate extremes</b></p>

<p>The successful candidates will be part of a nationwide lake programme Our Lakes, Our Future (ourlakesourfuture.co.nz). The programme aims to develop a set of globally unique approaches to monitoring and managing lakes. The successful candidates will be integrated into this internationally recognised lake research team and have opportunities to work in different organisations across Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>

<p>Position 1. Characterising lake responses to climate extremes using high-frequency sensor data<br>
We are seeking an enthusiastic and highly motivated student for a fully funded PhD project using high-frequency sensor data to understand lake ecosystem responses to climate extremes. Lakes are increasingly exposed to extreme climate events (e.g., intense storms, droughts), yet typical monitoring (manual to fortnightly) often prevents a robust understanding of the response and recovery of lake ecosystems following these events. We aim to analyse automated high-frequency sensor data from profiling buoys in lakes across Aotearoa New Zealand to characterise changes in lake ecosystem structure and function following some of the most extreme climate events observed in New Zealand (e.g., Cyclone Gabrielle). </p>


<p>Position 2. Investigating lake responses to extreme weather events using high-resolution paleoenvironmental reconstructions<br>
Climate change is already increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms and droughts, and these effects are forecast to worsen under future climate projections. For example, extreme rainfall caused by ex-tropical cyclones dramatically increases catchment runoff and causes erosion, delivering high sediment and nutrient loads to lake ecosystems. However, little is known about how lake ecosystems respond to these pulse disturbances, limiting attempts to forecast the impact of future climate scenarios on lakes in Aotearoa-New Zealand. We seek an enthusiastic and highly motivated student for a fully funded PhD project using paleoenvironmental reconstruction to understand lake ecosystem responses to extreme weather events. </p>

<p><b>Application deadline:</b> 15 November 2024. <b>Start date:</b> no later than March 2025. </p>
