<p> 2 PhD positions in plant ancient DNA research at the University of Bern, Switzerland </p>

<p>Within the framework of the SNSF Consolidator grant project ARIaDNA, two 4-year PhD positions are available at the Institute of Plant Sciences and Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research of the University of Bern, Switzerland. ARIaDNA aims to reconstruct how key European tree species responded to past environmental changes, using genetic data from ancient plant remains preserved in lake sediment archives. This work will provide critical insights for predicting future vegetation shifts and inform conservation strategies for alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>These two PhD positions provide a unique chance to contribute to ground-breaking research on forest ecosystems and climate adaptation through an interdisciplinary approach combining fieldwork, laboratory research, and computational modeling. Join us to help shape the future of climate change adaptation strategies for Europe's alpine forests!</p>

<p>See more details on <a href="https://www.ips.unibe.ch/research/paleo/popdyn/index_eng.html"><b> here</b></a> and <a href="https://ohws.prospective.ch/public/v1/jobs/c36e3118-85e3-4c02-9e26-9610a1420b69"><b> here</b></a></p>

<p>For further information contact Dr. Christoph Schw√∂rer at christoph.schwoerer@unibe.ch</p>
<p>Applications will be reviewed until the 31.12.2024, but further applications might be considered until the position is filled.</p>

<p>30-month post-doc </p>
A 30-month post-doc researcher (can be extended) is available in Bergen on the project BIOcean5D, a pan-European EU-funded consortia:
"BIOcean5D unites major European centres in molecular and cell biology; marine biology; and sequencing, together with 31 partners from 11 countries, to build a unique suite of technologies, protocols, and models allowing holistic re-exploration of marine biodiversity, from viruses to mammals, from genomes to holobionts, across multiple spatial and temporal scales, stretching from pre-industrial history to today. These two PhD positions provide a unique chance to contribute to ground-breaking research on forest ecosystems and climate adaptation through an interdisciplinary approach combining fieldwork, laboratory research, and computational modeling. Join us to help shape the future of climate change adaptation strategies for Europe's alpine forests! "</p>

<p> The post-doc project aims at mining global-scale metagenomics datasets of plankton and sediment biodiversity, to analyse the patterns of marine biodiversity from the sunlit surface to the deep-ocean floor. The main objective is to get a better understanding of the plankton communities that contribute most to carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. Another objective is to develop a better understanding of diverse and inconspicuous deep-sea benthic biodiversity using omics methods. </p>

<p>Further development towards sedimentary ancient DNA in marine settings are expected. </p>

<p>Starting date: June / July 2024. </p>
<p><b>Application deadline:</b> The review process will start immediately and the position will remain open until filled. </p>

<p>PhD position</p>
<p>A full-time PhD position is available in the fields of marine microbial ecology, paleogenomics and bioinformatics at <a href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/258181/phd-research-fellow-in-marine-microbial-ecology"><b> NORCE Climate and Environment</b></a> in Bergen, Norway.</p>

<p>The research will focus on the impact of past environmental change on marine microbial diversity in Norwegian and Arctic fjords using sedimentary ancient DNA. The position is available from 01.09.2024 and for a fixed-term period of 3 years. The position will be located at NORCE, and you will be enrolled as a PhD student at the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Bergen. <a href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/258181/phd-research-fellow-in-marine-microbial-ecology"><b> See here for more information</b></a></p>

<p><b>Applications deadline: March 24th, 2024.</b></p>
