  <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alois-Reveret">Aloïs Revéret</a> sincerely hopes that he will be able to submit his thesis and defend in time, although his track record does not quite plead for it.
    His <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14158">first paper</a> reviewed the methodologies detecting eDNA of freshwater aquatic plants, and showed that it can be leveraged to renconstruct abiotic variables.
    In his <a href="PAPER2_URL">second paper</a>, he investigates ten millennia of postglacial ecological succession at the southwestern edge of the Scandinavian peninsula.
    His <a href="PAPER3_URL">third paper</a> has mammoth in it.
    Aloïs also led the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43799-1_8">chapter on aquatic macrophytes</a> in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-43799-1">palaeolimology volume dedicated to sedimentary ancient DNA</a>, and contributed to an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323999311001719">encyclopedia article</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Aloïs is currently seeking a Nobel Prize.</b>
    His research interests are steep skiing and tasty cheese.</p>

<div class="section Ying">
  <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ying-Liu-369?ev=hdr_xprf">Ying Liu</a> successfully defended her Ph.D. in May 2025.
    Her research leverages sedimentary ancient DNA to investigate changes in plant communities across Arctic and alpine regions, focusing on the influence of abiotic factors and biotic interactions.
    Her <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108850">first paper</a> examines climate- and human-driven shifts in plant communities on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.
    The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56176-3">second paper</a> explores how species richness and average distribution range shifted during glacial–interglacial transitions in northeastern Siberia and Alaska.
    Her <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.26.656118">third study</a>, currently available as a preprint, investigates woody taxa encroachment during climate warming from glacial to interglacial periods, highlighting an increase in negative plant–plant interactions in the Arctic.
  </p>
  <p>Ying is currently a guest researcher at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Potsdam, Germany.
    In September, she will join the <a href="https://uit.no/research/arcecogen">ArcEcoGen research group</a> at Tromsø Museum (UiT), as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>

<div class="section Luke">
  <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucas-Elliott-3">Luke Elliott</a> successfully defended his Ph.D. this winter.
    His <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/quat6010007">first paper</a> investigates the influence of glacial activity on vegetation and soil properties on an island in northern Norway.
    His <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13926">second paper</a> advances the capacity of <i>sed</i>aDNA to study intraspecific genetic diversity for palaeo-phylogeography.
    His third work, released as a <a href="https://doi.org/10.22541/au.172529953.39892767/v1">preprint</a>, is a bionformatical pipeline that annotates metagenomic datasets based on genome skims.
    He is preparing a manuscript to compare the taxonomic yield of metabarcoding, shotgun metagenomics, and target capture.</p>
  <p>Luke is currently working as a postdoc with the <a href="https://uit.no/research/arcecogen">ArcEcoGen research group</a> at Tromsø Museum (UiT).</p>

<div class="section Izabella">
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Izabella-Baisheva">Izabella Baisheva</a> successfully defended her Ph.D., which constitutes a major contribution to the limnology of Yakutia by applying <i>sed</i>aDNA metabarcoding of diatoms, macrophytes and terrestrial plants.
  Her <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10933-023-00285-w">first paper</a> reconstructs the sequential formation and biological history of Lake Satagay, a thermokarst lake in Central Yakutia.
  Her <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.962906">second paper</a> explores how this lake's surrounding vegetation was affected by wildfire activity during the Holocene.
  In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2024.1354284">third paper</a>, she investigated an intermontane basin lake in southwestern Yakutia, providing an unprecedented insight on freshwater and vegetation dynamics from the region between Lake Baikal and Central Yakutia, since the Last Glacial Maximum.
  She is developing a manuscript assessing the environmental and biological status of 66 lakes across Central Yakutia and the Oymyakon Plateau.
</p>
<p>Izabella is currently a visiting researcher at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research (Chinese Academy of Sciences), and a guest researcher at AWI, Potsdam, Germany.
<b>She is looking for a postdoctoral position in or around the Netherlands</b>, any recommendations or connections would be well appreciated.</p>
