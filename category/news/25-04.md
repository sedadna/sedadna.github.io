<div class="intro">
<p> Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>

<p>Welcome to our April 2025 newsletter!</p>

<p>We would like to remind everyone that seminars are held once a month specifically for early career researchers (ERCs) / students, on the first Thursday of the month, to be able to talk about your research and exchange with fellow ERCs also working on sedaDNA. Seminars occur in two timezones, and are organised by Ines Barrenechea (Europe-Africa time zone) and Jordan Von Eggers (Americas time zone). Any early career member is more than welcome to join - you can sign up by emailing Ines (ines.a.angeles@uit.no) or Jordan (jvonegge@uwyo.edu).</p>

<p>If you would like meet fellow sedaDNA enthusiasts in person, please remember to <a href="https://nordicsocietyoikos.glueup.com/event/2nd-sedadna-scientific-society-conference-125115/home.html">register</a> for our second sedaDNA meeting in Tromsø (Norway) this coming June. Early bird registration is until the 14th of March, and registration closes the 1st of April. </p>


<p>A frriendly reminder that if you would like to advertise something to the society, you are welcome to get in touch with me (Maïlys Picard, mailys.picard@umu.se) or share your news directly with all of our members using the mailing list <a href="mailto:sedadna-society@googlegroups.com">sedadna-society@googlegroups.com</a>. The present newsletter distribution list is only one-way, to send the newsletter. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Wishing you a great month of March,</p>
<p>The organising board</p>
