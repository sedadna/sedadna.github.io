</div>

<div class="intro">
<p> Dear sed-DNA enthusiasts,</p>

<p>Welcome to our April 2025 newsletter!</p>

<p>One major news this month is that we are re-organising the organising board! Warm welcome to Scarlett Zetter, Vilma Perez, and Aloïs Réveret, you can read more about them and their new roles on our <a href="https://sedadna.github.io/category/board.html">website</a>. We would like to thank all past members, particularly XX and XX for their help with XX and XX. 

<p>We would like to remind everyone that seminars are held once a month specifically for early career researchers (ERCs) / students, on the first Thursday of the month, to be able to talk about your research and exchange with fellow ERCs also working on sedaDNA. Seminars occur in two timezones, and are organised by Ines Barrenechea (Europe-Africa time zone) and Jordan Von Eggers (Americas time zone). Any early career member is more than welcome to join - you can sign up by emailing Ines (ines.a.angeles@uit.no) or Jordan (jvonegge@uwyo.edu).</p>

<p>A frriendly reminder that the present newsletter distribution list is only one-way, to send the newsletter. If you would like to advertise something to the society, please use our general mailing list <a href="mailto:sedadna-society@googlegroups.com">sedadna-society@googlegroups.com</a>. You are also welcome to get in touch with me regarding news or queries (Maïlys Picard, mailys.picard@umu.se). We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Wishing you a great month of April,</p>
<p>The organising board</p>

<div class="intro">
<h4 class="section-title underline">New Positions</h4> 
    
<p>A <b>Postdoc position</b> in ancient environmental genomics at the University of Copenhagen. This project will explore the relationship between environmental changes and human demographics, disease load, and site histories by analysing ancient environmental DNA (eDNA). By extracting DNA from various archaeological contexts, including soil monoliths and discrete samples from around Europe, the study aims to reconstruct past environments and assess their impact on human populations. The project seek to pioneer the use of ancient metagenomes to address standing archaeological questions in collaboration with researchers across most of Europe. Through advanced techniques like deep shotgun metagenomics, this work seeks to enhance our understanding of anthropogenic environments in Western Eurasia. Funding is for <b>two years</b>, start date as soon as possible, at the <a href="https://globe.ku.dk/research/geogenetics/">Centre for Ancient Environmental Genomics</a>, Globe Institute, UCPH, in Copenhagen. </p>
<p><b>Qualifications & Skills</b>:
<ul>
  <li>A background in genetics, bioinformatics or like.</li>
  <li>Experience with ancient DNA analysis.</li>
  <li>Strong analytical skills and an interest in interdisciplinary research.</li>
  <li>Ability to work both independently and collaboratively in an international research environment.</li>
</ul> </p>
<p>If you are interested, send your questions or your CV directly to Mikkel (Asst Prof. Mikkel Winther Pedersen, mwpedersen@sund.ku.dk).</p>
