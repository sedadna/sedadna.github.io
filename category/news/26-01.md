<h4 class="section-title underline">New Positions</h4> 
    
<p align="justify">A <a href="https://careers.universiteitleiden.nl/job/Postdoctoral-researcher-in-sedimentary-DNA-analysis-of-human-wildlife-relationships/16228-en_US"><b>Postdoctoral position</b></a> in sedimentary DNA analysis of human-wildlife relationships at the Faculty of Archaeology, University of Leiden. </p>
<p align="justify">The Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University, is looking for a postdoctoral researcher (4 years, 0.6 FTE) to join the ERC-funded project WILDERFARM and carry out cutting-edge research on human-wildlife relationships during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition using sedimentary DNA analysis, and to assist in WILDERFARM’s public outreach, data management, and other laboratory work.
The position is part of the ERC-funded Starting Grant project WILDERFARM - ‘Where the wild things were: how the rise of farming changed human-wildlife relationships’. WILDERFARM explores the significant changes in human-wildlife relationships that occurred with the rise of farming in western Europe between 6000 and 2000 BCE. Using an interdisciplinary combination of methods, WILDERFARM examines how early farmers renegotiated the age-old relationship with wild animals and how the rise of farming and its activities, such as livestock grazing and crop husbandry, affected wildlife.
The WILDERFARM project is divided into four interconnected Work Packages (WP):
WP1: Identifying how human exploitation of wild animals changed over time.
WP2: Examining the overlap between farming activities and wildlife habitats.
WP3: Controlling for whether human-wildlife relationships were affected by environmental change.
WP4: Clarifying the nature and timing of the Neolithic transition based on changes in the human-wildlife relationship. Evaluating how the archaeology of human-wildlife relationships can contribute to conservation education in the present.</p>
