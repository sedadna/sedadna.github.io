<div class="intro">
<p> Dear sedaDNA enthusiasts,</p>

<p align="justify">Hello and welcome to the July newsletter!</p>
 
<p align="justify">First, we wanted to say thank you to everyone who joined the sedaDNA conference in Tromsø! We hope you were able to catch up with everyone you wanted to, and maybe even managed to make some new friends. To all of you who couldn't make it; you were missed and we hope to see you next time. Finally, thank you to everyone in Tromsø for making the conference happen. The next sedaDNA conference will be in Copenhagen in 2027, and we are looking forward to seeing you there! </p>

<p align="justify">To add to the news, we wanted to draw attention to a new page that is being launched on the website. To support the Early Career Researchers in our field, we wanted to provide some visibility for them and their work. So, we created a new page featuring <a href="https://sedadna.github.io/category/new-graduates.html"><b>recently graduated researchers</b></a>, to provide a short overview of the thesis and status of employment. While we don't have the ability to backtrack everybody, if you obtained your PhD in <b>2024</b> or later and want to be displayed, please fill in <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/3/form/view/6930ce57dee0ca03f35a2e171c2f0257/"><b>this form</b></a> (or send an email to <a href="mailto:alois.n.reveret@uit.no">here</a>) to be displayed in the "sedaDNA Hall of Fame"! We ask you to fill in the following information:<br />
- Name <br />
- Photo <br />
- Date of defence <br />
- Affiliation <br />
- Link, title, and a brief overview of the thesis <br />
- A website link (optional) <br />
- If you're currently looking for a job (or your current position)<p/>

<p align="justify">Finally to the research, over the course of June, eight papers and six preprints were published. There is one job position to announce and no new conference sessions at the moment (see the <a href="https://sedadna.github.io/category/events.html"><b>Events</b></a> tab for other events previously announced).</p> 


<p>Wishing you a fabulous July,</p>
<p>The organising board</p>

<h4 class="section-title underline">New positions</h4>
<p align="justify"> <a href="https://www.norceresearch.no/en/research-group/mep-molecular-ecology-paleogenomics"> <b>The Molecular Ecology & Paleogenomics (MEP)</b> </a> lab at NORCE Climate and Environment in Bergen, Norway are looking for a fulltime permanent lab engineer. For full position details <a href="https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/282953/laboratory-engineer"> <b>click here</b> </a>. Application deadline is <b>1st August 2025</b>.</p>
About the position: <br />
The Molecular Ecology and Paleogenomics Research Group (MEP) applies molecular tools to address basic ecological and climatic questions. Our research covers marine and fresh water, sediments, and sea ice and contribute to a better understanding, and a sound management, of marine and freshwater ecosystems. MEP has a project portfolio that includes research projects funded by the Norwegian Research Council (RCN), European Research Council (ERC) and EU-H2020. We are now seeking a highly motivated laboratory engineer to strengthen our research group and contribute to driving our research forward. The engineer will be involved in a range of different research tasks within MEP and have a major role in further development of our laboratory facilities, with a special responsibility for our ancient DNA laboratory, developing and applying molecular tools to address ecological research questions, as well as instructing and supporting students and guest researchers in the aDNA lab. In addition, we frequently go out to sea on research expeditions, and participation in field sample collection is encouraged.<br />
Please email any questions about the position to Research Director <a href="mailto:aula@norceresearch.no">Aud Larsen</a>.
