<p> Dear sedaDNA enthusiasts,</p>

<p align="justify">Hello and welcome to the July newsletter! Just wanted to say a quick thank you to everyone who joined the sedaDNA conference, it was such a wonderful display of how our community is thriving. We hope you were able to catch up with everyone you wanted to, and managed to make some new friends! Thank you to everyone in Tromsø for making the conference happen. We are looking forward to Copenhagen 2027!!
 
This past month XXX papers and XXX preprints have been published. No new conference session to announce at the moment (see the <a href="https://sedadna.github.io/category/events.html"><b>Events</b></a> tab for other events previously announced).</p> 


<p>IWishing you a fabulous July,</p>
<p>The organising board</p>

<p align="justify">A <a href="https://coreykrabbenhoft.com/join-us-2/"><b>PhD position</b></a> on the <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/research/degrees/available-projects/projects/marine-and-antarctic/genomics-of-southern-ocean-carbon-pump/_nocache">Genomics of Southern Ocean carbon pump</a> at the University of Tasmania (UTAS), in collaboration with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). </p>
<p align="justify">The carbon fixed from atmospheric CO2 by phytoplankton in the sunlit parts of the ocean is exported to depth, sequestering it for decades to millennia via a process called the biological carbon pump. However, most of this organic matter is remineralized by bacteria colonizing the sinking particles. By the time particles reach a depth of 1000m ≤5% of the organic carbon remains. The Southern Ocean is an important component of the ocean's biological pump and the subantarctic zone (SAZ) is of particular interest due to its deep winter mixing and Subantarctic Mode Water formation, which supply oxygen and nutrients to the subsurface Southern Hemisphere (Rintoul and Trull 2001, Helm et al. 2011). In this region sediment traps that collect sinking particles have been deployed since 1997 (Wynn-Edwards et al. 2020), providing a direct way to determine what makes up the biological pump. This project will use genetic analysis of sediment trap material to shed light on the microbial taxa – zooplankton, phytoplankton, and bacteria –that contribute to particle flux and remineralization (Liu et al. 2020, Cardozo-Mino et al. 2023). Determining who contributes most to these carbon pathways is fundamental to predicting change. Microbes identified genetically from sediment trap samples will be compared to those identified microscopically from surface samples, to determine whether numerically dominant but small species or rare but large species contribute most to carbon export. The sediment trap sampling resolution is on average two weeks, which means that timeseries analyses may reveal what changes have occurred over the past 20 years due to changing ocean properties. Comparing sediment trap samples from the same timeframe across the three depths (1000m, 2000m and 3800m) will inform the vertical patterns of microbial community progression and may even indicate influences of alternative particle sources.
